## Description of the project
The main motivation is to put into practice what is related to the Node.js environment through which JavaScript programs can be executed outside the browser, which I consider a first step towards the development of the backend. Also using a command line application (CLI) to obtain from the “user” certain information, and then process it and generate a result, in this case a MarkDown format file.

It was a challenge to understand everything that Node.js requires for its correct operation, from the installation of Node.js itself, the initialization of the NPM (Node Package Manager), the installation of the packages (such as “inquirer”) and the “package.json” file where the configured information is registered.

It is very motivating to understand that these new tools will allow us to continue using JavaScript for the integral development of web applications.

Finally, it turned out to be a great challenge for me to incorporate the requested video tutorial into my delivery. I had never produced a video of this nature before. After many attempts and exhausting the 10 recordings of the free version, I was finally able to generate a video of acceptable quality and incorporate it into my delivery. I consider it very valuable to incorporate this learning, as it is definitely a great way to provide users with a support tool for using the applications.

A great learning from this challenge is to read and understand all the documentation recommended before being able to get down to work, and make a better planning of the activities to develop and the time that these will be demanding me. I think that even the time that the learning curve is demanding me is very high, and that I have invested too much time in some activities, as in the elaboration of the video tutorial, because when I thought that I had a good enough video, it lasted more than 5 minutes, but then I read in the recommended video presentation guide, that the recommended duration was 2 minutes maximum, so I had to repeat the work.
