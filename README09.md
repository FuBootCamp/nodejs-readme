## Description of the project
Note taker, is a basic “full-stack” application that allows to write, save and query notes using a JSON file for data storage.As the challenge indicated, the back end of the application was coded with node.js “express” and the delivery has been done through Render.The main motivation for this challenge was to implement a local server to serve user requests and to learn how to code the endpoints to serve CRUD requests. This challenge is definitely a basic version of the overall operation of the type of applications I might be coding in the future. For this challenge it was fundamental to deeply understand the programming logic of the mini-project of this module, since in addition to understanding the coding of express, it was very important to understand the modularization of the application, the routing of the modules, and the “mount” of the routes and the modules themselves.
